# Cloning the Repository

## With SSH
To clone via SSH, use
```git clone ssh://git@gitlab.com/yeetchat/yeetchat-server```

## With HTTP(-S)
To clone using HTTPS, use
```git clone https://gitlab.yeetchat.xyz/server```

## Notices

1. Github mirror might soon be available
2. Using SSH requires an SSH Key (and perms)
3. Using <https://gitlab.yeetchat.xyz/yeetchat-server> or <https://gitlab.com/yeetchat/yeetchat-server> for cloning will work under HTTPS.
4. For SSH cloning, you must use the gitlab.com/yeetchat address, as the gitlab.yeetchat.xyz domain will not work for SSH cloning, therefor...
